## Documentation
* See [Documentation.md](Documentation.md)

## Installation
Place `vs_library.nut` in your vscripts directory `/csgo/scripts/vscripts/`

### Downloading
**Method 1.** Manually download the library by right clicking [**HERE**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samisalreadytaken/vs_library/master/vs_library.nut), and choosing _"Save Link As..."_.  
After acquiring the file, place it in your vscripts directory: `/csgo/scripts/vscripts/`

**Method 2.** Using [curl](https://github.com/curl/curl), use the following line to download the library directly into your game files.
```
cd "W:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive/csgo/scripts/vscripts/";curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samisalreadytaken/vs_library/master/vs_library.nut
```

## Usage
Add this following line in the beginning of your script: `IncludeScript("vs_library")`

Done!

It only needs to be included once in the lifetime of the map running in the server. Including it more than once does not affect the performance. 

### Setting up basis event listeners
Set up these event listeners to automatically validate player userids. This will let you access player userids, SteamIDs, and Steam names.

Entity targetnames are arbitrary.
```
logic_eventlistener:
	targetname: player_connect
	EventName:  player_connect
	FetchEventData: Yes

	OnEventFired > player_connect > RunScriptCode > VS.Events.player_connect(event_data)

logic_eventlistener:
	targetname: player_spawn
	EventName:  player_spawn
	FetchEventData: Yes

	OnEventFired > player_spawn   > RunScriptCode > VS.Events.player_spawn(event_data)
```

You can access the player data via their scope.
```cs
player.GetScriptScope().userid
player.GetScriptScope().networkid
player.GetScriptScope().name
```

You can get the player handle from their userid.
```lua
local player = VS.GetPlayerByUserid(userid)
```

Use `VS.DumpPlayers(1)` to see every player data.
```
] script VS.DumpPlayers(1)

=======================================

   userid = 24
   name = "Ethan"
--- End script dump
[BOT]    - ([3] player) :: b02f4f5e377_player
